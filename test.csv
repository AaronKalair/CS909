anattempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticatedcapital market instruments banking sources said interest rate and currency swaps and currency options areunder closest scrutiny and if revisions are made they mayresemble regulation jointly proposed by the us and uk tojapan juergen becker director of the bundesbanks division ofbanking law and credit supervision said the usbritishproposals were interesting but declined to elaborate but banking sources said west germany was more likely toproduce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals there is no formal plan yet but talks are in the latterstages one representative of the german banking association incologne said bankers expect rule changes this year all alterations must be approved by the bundesbank westgermanys four major banking associations and the federalbanking supervisory office talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changeswould require a revision of germanys credit law which hasbeen in effect since authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fitpresent circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentarypolitical process of changing it banking sources said since the beginning of the banking law has limitedbanks lending to times shareholders equity plus reserveson a consolidated basis but lending ratios do not extend to several newerinstruments such as spot and forward currency contractscurrency and interest swaps commercial paper programscurrency options interest rate futures in foreign currenciesand various innovative types of interest rate hedges the sources said the main value of the usuk proposalslay in differentiating between different types of risk factorand for instance in placing greater weight on currency swapsthan interest swaps but even if german banking authoritiesagree with some of the assessments of swaps they disagree onhow to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk usbritish proposals include a complicated series offormulae for assessing the stream of payments involved inswaps whose ultimate risk is borne by the financialintermediary especially when counterparties remain anonymousthis is the socalled markettomarket value but german authorities are likely to consider this much toocomplex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule oflending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness ofthe borrowers involved the sources said the weightings also likely if lending ratios are extendedto include banks securities portfolios are zero for publicauthorities pct for domestic banks pct for foreignbanks and pct for other foreign and nonbank borrowers a further complication is that the more flexibledefinitions of equity allowed in the us and the uk may putgerman banks at a competitive disadvantage the sources said stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version ofthe usuk proposals could far exceed the intent of the usand british authorities the sources said one specialist for dresdner bank ag said a longdatedforeign exchange forward transaction could for instance bebrought under the same rule as a crosscurrency swap despitethe fact that the risk may be entirely different how new regulations will affect foreign banks here wasuncertain many have converted to full subsidiary status andapplied for a full banking licence over the last two years inorder to leadmanage mark eurobonds

themark president of the powerful and independent west germancentral bank the bundesbank poehl is likely to have hiscontract renewed for another eight years when it expires at theend of this year government officials say index of economic spotlights see page ecra but no official announcement has yet been made raisingeyebrows in west germanys business community the ebullient poehl spent seven years in bonn in topministerial posts under the social democrats now inopposition before he moved to the bundesbank there has been speculation that chancellor helmut kohlwould try to replace poehl with a man closer to his ownchristian democrats but officials noted that poehl has workedclosely and successfully with finance minister gerhardstoltenberg since kohls government took office in poehl the most senior central banker apart from paulvolcker of the united states enjoys a strong internationalreputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up given these circumstances kohl will probably overlookpoehls past as an adviser to former social democrat chancellorwilly brandt and top aide to helmut schmidt when he wasfinance minister bankers said it was schmidt who aschancellor appointed poehl to his present job in in recent months with the marks strong rise against thedollar poehl has made exchange rates the central concern ofthe bundesbanks council a highly conservative institutionwhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to preventinflation catching hold older germans can remember two boutsof galloping inflation this century but with consumer prices falling for much of andinflation negligible so far this year poehl thinks it is safeto relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on thedangers to the german economy of a bloated exchange rate i am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise thedollarmark rate have reached a high priority also for thebundesbank because a further massive revaluation of the markwould endanger the economy in west germany he told businessjournalists in frankfurt recently ute geipel head of research at citibank ag says thatpoehls reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy poehls policy has always been a policy which does notfocus so rigidly on domestic factors but also on the externaleconomy she said an economist at a german bank who declined to beidentified said if poehl is confirmed in his post it willcertainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not sorigidly oriented towards money supply one of poehls great struggles recently has been topersuade the united states to stop talking down the dollar forpoehl the significance of the february louvre accord was thatthe united states agreed to join efforts to stabilisecurrencies the louvre accord was greeted with scepticism by currencydealers who said they would soon put it to the test but infact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact this is because the markets know or perhaps because theydont know what the central banks can do poehl says ofintervention in currency markets which can quickly turn ratesround making a speculators position worthless poehl was born in and worked as a financial journalistin the s before starting his ministerial career a relaxed suntanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes overa glass of beer he is hardly a stereotype central banker he is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football andplay golf poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitutefor correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced but you can achieve an enormous effect with a small

commercial banks in cases where developingnations are carrying out genuine economic reforms in addition he signaled that the banks might want toreconsider the idea of a megabank where third world debt wouldbe pooled and suggested the administration would support sucha plan even though it was not formally proposing it at thesame time however the official expressed reservations thatsuch a scheme would ever get off the ground the philippine proposal together with argentinesuggestions that exit bonds be issued to end the troublesomerole of small banks in the debt strategy would help tounderpin the flagging role of private banks within the planthe official said in an interview with reuters all of these things would fit within the definition of ourinitiative as we have asked it and we think any novel andunique approach such as those should be considered said theofficial who asked not to be named in october washington outlined a debt crisis strategyunder which commercial banks and multilateral institutions suchas the world bank and the international monetary fund imfwere urged to step up lending to major debtors nations in return america called on the debtor countries to enacteconomic reforms promoting inflationfree economic growth the multilaterals have been performing well the debtorshave been performing well said the official but he admittedthat the largest third

commercial banks improvetheir role in resolving the third world debt crisis we called at the very beginning for the bank syndicationsto find procedures or processes whereby they could operate moreeffectively the official said among those ideas the official said were suggestions thatcommercial banks create a megabank which could swap third worlddebt paper for socalled exit bonds for banks like regionalamerican or european institutions such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need tolend money to their former debtors every time a new moneypackage was assembled and has been suggested by argentina inits current negotiations for a new loan of billion dlrs he emphasised that the megabank was not an administrationplan but something some people have suggested other us officials said japanese commercial banks areexamining the creation of a consortium bank to assume thirdworld debt this plan actively under consideration woulddiffer slightly from the one the official described but the official expressed deep misgivings that such a planwould work in the united states if the banks thought that that was a suitable way to gofine i dont think they ever will he pointed out that banks would swap their third worldloans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctantto provide new money to debtors through the new institution meanwhile the official praised the philippine plan underwhich it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at nomore than pct above libor the philippine proposal is very interesting its quiteunique and i dont think its something that should becategorically rejected out of hand the official said banks which found this level unacceptably low would beoffered an alternative of libor payments in cash and a marginabove that of one pct in the form of philippine investmentnotes these tradeable dollardenominated notes would have asixyear life and if banks swapped them for cash beforematurity the country would guarantee a payment of pointover libor until now bankers have criticised these spreads as far toolow the talks now in their second week are aimed atstretching out repayments of billion dlrs of debt andgranting easier terms on billion of already rescheduleddebt the country which has enjoyed strong political supportin washington since corazon aquino came to power early lastyear owes an overall billion dlrs of debt but the official denied the plan amounts to interest ratecapitalisation a development until now unacceptable to thebanks its no more interest rate capitalisation than if youhave a write down in the spread over libor from what existedbefore the official said in comments suggesting some ought tobe granted the rate concessions they seek some people arguethat cutting the spread is debt forgiveness

the fed set a day period for public comment on the plan the proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risksassociated with interest rate swaps forward foreign exchangecontracts and similar

using credit conversion factors based on statisticalanalyses by the staffs of the bank of england and us bankingregulators future exposure would rise over the life of theasset the fed staff said the

industrialised nations tocooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies in a lecture at the university of surrey prereleasedhere koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation wasprotectionism and control on capital movements central banks have sufficient experience of exchange markettransactions to steer exchange rates where they want to havethem he said he added that west german growth forecasts wouldhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar dropto marks from above two marks at the start of koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange marketshad parted company with transactions in goods services andinvestments it was the scale of speculative transactions thatdetermined market trends speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates togrow to reverse such a rise in the money stock interest rateswould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off in other words the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity koehler said the dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive uscurrent account deficit but attempts to keep the depreciationgoing by talking the dollar down posed problems the sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steeprise in the cost of us imports and a sharp fall in the costof european imports but the volume effect of falling importsto the us and rising imports to europe would take time tomake itself felt compared with the price effect hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be goingfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current accountover the medium term koehler said a reduction in the us current account deficit would occuronly if the growth rate of gnp was higher than domestic demandin japan and west germany by contrast domestic demand shouldrise faster than gnp in germany this did indeed happen in koehler said if a further appreciation of the dollar was to beprevented the us current account deficit could be offset byan inflow of foreign funds into the us but only if there was an appropriate interest ratedifferential would europe and japan look for financialinvestment in the us when selecting monetary policy instruments a central bankhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact itsmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions koehler said the bundesbank was changing money market ratesby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leadinginterest rates because of the signal this gives to the marketand its substantial impact on exchange rates it was not only important to achieve the domestic goals ofprice stability economic growth and full employment but alsoto tackle international problems like the exchange rateproblem the debt problem and the current account problem a strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguardingof noninflationary economic growth in an internationalmonetary system largely free of disruptions koehler said given the system of floating exchange rates it wasnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene it sufficedto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates overthe next few years and intervention points should not be setbecause they were only testing points for the market he said in order to keep the international monetary system free ofdisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly butalso cooperate on interest rate policies koehler said reutermoney-fx,lawson says his sterlingtarget comments were

too sophisticated toconvert into financial terms one banking source said but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions isimpossible to calculate they say it is blurred by the poor

really mean anything only that poland will notbe treated worse than other countries it will be difficult toregain access to the us market because different forces arein play now said one western envoy

march,a leading us farmstatecongressman jerry huckaby dla warned he will press nextyear for legislation to control domestic production ofsweeteners perhaps including corn sweeteners if the industryfails to voluntarily halt output increases this year were moving toward a direction where we couldselfdestruct the us sugar program rep huckaby chairmanof the house agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugarissues told reuters in an interview huckaby who told us sugarbeet growers earlier this yearthey must halt production increases said he will deliver thesame message to louisiana sugarcane growers friday he alsosaid he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domesticsweetener output increases is an effort to forestall furthercuts in the sugar import quota now at one mln short tons i think if were talking about dropping the quotaanother half mln tons lets say youre getting to the pointwhere the program might not work he said ideally id like to freeze things right where we aresaid huckaby leading advocate for sugar growers in congress a freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about thecurrent level of mln tons the corn sweetener share of theus market staying at just over pct and us sugar importsholding at about mln tons huckaby said a decision on whether to seek legislation will not be madeuntil output numbers are known late this year he said i feel like if we didnt expand production we couldprobably hold where we are indefinitely or at least throughthe farm bill without any changes in the sugar programhuckaby said however much depends on whether highfructose corn syrupproducers continue to expand their share of the us sweetenermarket from just over pct huckaby said he noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners willcapture at most only another pct of the sweetener market inthe us but he said if there were an economic breakthrough in theproduction of a new crystalline corn sweetener which furtherexpanded the corn sweetener share then us sugar importsmight be eliminated and us sugar output severely reduced huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refinercompanies such as ae staley and archer daniels midland soon this program is advantageous to the corn users they havesome natural legitimate selfinterest in seeing that theprogram is preserved huckaby said huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives tothink about how domestic output could be controlled eitherthrough production allocations acreage or marketing controls huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from thejustice department to determine if it would be legal to askcorn refiners to limit production i dont know if we will go this route but if we dotheres a question in my mind at this point in time can you dothat legally he said asked if he would proceed with production controls withoutthe support of corn refiners huckaby said you build a fragilehouse if you do it that way huckaby said he understands why us cane and beet farmershave expanded production because high sugar price supportmeans returns from sugar are higher than competing crops suchas soybeans and grain but he said for sugar growers as a whole expansion wouldnot be good policy huckaby said he has tried to stress in his speeches tosugar industry groups that if growers continue to expand theymay be penalized retroactively under any production controllegislation passed next year huckaby said congress is unlikely to approve any changes inthe sugar program this year despite a reagan administrationproposal to drastically slash the program the administration proposal is so drastic that i dontthink it will get up a head of steam huckaby said he said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar pricesupport is unlikely to be approved instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar programhuckaby said the reagan administration should file a complaintwith the general

policy,frankfurt april,bundesbank council member lotharmueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policyand that restraining money supply growth does not always meanpushing up interest rates mueller said in an article for the boersen zeitungfinancial daily that a monetary policy which took into accountexchange rate expectations and capital flows could not beconfused with an exchange rate oriented policy the article followed international press speculation thatthe bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favourof an exchange rate policy mueller a member of the bundesbank council in his positionas president of the regional state central bank in bavarianoted that the bundesbanks decision in january to cut leadinginterest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had ledsome people to think it was dropping monetary targetting simply to ignore the external economic context would berisky and dangerous for monetary policy he explained mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put anend to interest rate speculation the bundesbank could nowassume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currencyinflows slow down lower money market rates achieved by widening short andlong term interest rate differentials also encouragedinvestors to reinvest funds parked in liquid accounts muellersaid the measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetarygrowth back onto the desired path he said finally of course and there is no need to keep thisquiet the cut in interest rates was also in line with thechanged economic situation of the last few months he added all in all the bundesbank in no way abandoned its moneysupply policy with the january discount rate cut despitesuppositions to the contrary mueller said keeping money supply developments in check is not alwayssynonymous with raising interest rates especially whenexcessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad rather thangrowth in bank credits is the cause of rising monetaryholdings of nonbanks mueller said now that west germany no longer ran large external deficitsother concepts were needed for monetary policy mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous formonetary policy to pursue a specific markdollar exchange rate in any case the exchange rate partly depends on uscurrency and budgetary policy and the us economy he said but an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end ofa strict stability policy because both interest rates andliquidity would be affected by required currency interventionand could no longer be steered autonomously by the bundesbank even interest rates are not in the centre of thebundesbanks considerations but reflect competition and othermarket conditions mueller said a cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence centralbank money stock the bundesbanks main money supply indicator this does not reflect banking liquidity but the liquidityof industry and households which cannot be directly reachedwith the bundesbanks instruments mueller said the less dependent nonbanks are on bank credits theharder it is to steer money supply this has increasingly beenthe case recently because nonbanks have received considerablesums from current account surpluses and capital imports if the bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply risewith higher interest rates as would have been appropriate ifcredit was growing excessively it would not only have missedits target but probably even set off further inflows he said mueller said growth in money supply was still too high in the last three months money stock grew at an annual rateof seven pct down from pct in the previous quarter the growth curve has therefore come closer to the three tosix pct target corridor for central bank money stockgrowth pointing to the success of the current policy he said but high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and thereshould be no change in priorities monetary policy must befirst and foremost

and isunlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest ratesin the near future they said the council will meet in saarbruecken and the meeting willbe followed by a news conference at around

interest rates when this would be better held in reservethe bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder he said a cut in the discount or lombard rates to bring them inline with the new structure of money market rates since lastmonth would have little practical significance dealers said the bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted adiplomatic gesture before next weeks venice summit

the bundesbank to ease monetarypolicy to meet pressure on west germany at the venice summit but with bonn struggling to finance already announced taxcuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal

in an increasingly fastmoving globaleconomy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices thenewest member of the federal reserve board says commodity prices are already considered by the fed in themaking of monetary policy but they would be given a muchgreater role under an idea being floated by governor robertheller who joined the board last august he conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed butargues that such an arrangement particularly if it wereadopted by other major industrial countries could reduce thevolatility of exchange rates moreover it could help stabilize of the prices ofcommodities themselves slowing changes in inflation his idea which many conservative economists findappealing has some backing among board members appointed inrecent years by president reagan it would complement the present system of opening orclosing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflationkey indicators such as unemployment and the rise or fall ofthe money supply changes in the money supply can lead tochanges in interest rates and affect economic activitydirectly discussed on and off for a long time the commodity conceptis part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetarypolicy and widelyfluxtuating currency prices to a more solidbase what is needed is an anchor or reference point that canserve as a guide for both domestic and international monetarypurposes says heller in the past this anchor was gold but the united stateswent off the gold standard because the global economy hadvastly outstripped gold supplies a return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out ofhand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largestproducers of gold are the soviet union and south africa the socalled fixed rate system scuttled in the earlys is still considered unworkable in the present world but the current system of floating currencies in whichcurrencies can fluxtuate widely adding vast pressures to themonetary system is also being widely questioned some have suggested that the system might benefit from aformal approach that mandates intervention by countries whencurrencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there aremajor problems with this also for one thing there is justifiable concern that countriesmight be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might bedetrimental to their own domestic economy moreover some question whether concerted intervention canmake much of an inpact if the overall market does not agreewith the fundamental judgement the poorest countries have called for a monetary conferenceto work out a new system that not surprisingly helps themcope with their overpowering debt problems treasury secretary james baker the reagan administrationschief economic architect has preferred to use the socalledgroup of five industrial countries or sometimes seven as aforum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and othereconomic matters he appears convinced that officials from west germanyfrance britain japan italy and canada talking quietly behindclosed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from publicposturing the heller approach while extremely complex could have aprofound impact on the system ideally stabalizing prices andinternational exchange rates as envisioned by heller a basket of say majorcommodities ranging from wheat to oil would be put togetherand prices would be measured on a regular basis in times of rising commodity prices monetary policy mightbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices montarypolicy might be eased he says he notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auctionmarkets and a commodity price index can be calculated on avirtually continuous basis moreover most commodity prices are produced consumed andtraded on a worldwide basis so that an index has a relevancefor the entire world he says in addition commodity prices are at the beginning of theproduction chain and serve as an imput into virtually allproduction processes focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitiveindicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressuresthe monetary authorities may take such an index into account inmaking their monetary policy decisions he says however he says that any major change in a basic commoditysuch as occurred in oil during the s because of action bythe opec cartel would have to be discounted in such a system he says the worst thing that could happen is to allowmonetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodityto the rest of the system and to other commodities

insufficient to cover such expenditure they said the boards cash crisis has serious implications for theeconomy as a whole since coffee accounts for pct ofugandas total exports the cmbs financial difficulties first started in januaryfollowing delays in railfreighting export consignments ofcoffee to the ports of mombasa dar es salaam and tanga these delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons inuganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport ugandanwagons across lake victoria to link up with the kenyan andtanzanian railway systems the sources said marketing minister john

eight weeks to recycleexport receipts into payments to local producers whereasexport bills handled by local banks took half that time toprocess they said the sources said the cmbs price structure had

rates although optimism infinancial markets might push for big moves quickly he told a briefing of economic journalists that i dontthink we should rush anything lawson stressed the themes ofgradualism

thekey public sector borrowing requirement psbr of pct ofgdp lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates both madethis month in the form of half percentage point declines wereperfectly consistent with monetary conditions now in britain he supported that by saying the narrow m money supplyaggregate was safely inside its flucuation band of two to sixpct set for both and in his budget lawson setno explicit target range for the broader sterling m turning to the question of britain eventually joining theexchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system emslawson repeated that it is most unlikely we will enter beforethe next election he said britain was keeping the subject of full emsmembership under constant review but he would not indicatewhat the chief considerations for this were for the government prime minister margaret thatcher late last year said adecision on whether or not to join depended on the strength ofthe uk economy but she later said such a move depended onother ems countries scrapping residual capital controls although lawson denounced what he said was the current waveof election fever in britain he added it is more likely thatthere will be an

predictedthat with treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would haveallowed the government to reach its goal of pct in one move but it was being praised today by political analysts as ashrewd move

undershot his original assumption of billionstg for by some three billion stg returning to changing levels of interest rates lawsonstressed that they are not an objective for the government they are an instrument of policy consequently the treasury hadno precise target for domestic borrowing levels he said but there may be interest rate consequences from changes inthe level of government borrowing he added lawson said he did not think that the uks relativelyhigh level of real interest rates had hurt investment inbritain he said conditions created by londons role as a leadingfinancial centre had caused sterling interest rates to behigher in real terms than in other countries three factors had caused the higher level in relativeinterest rates in britain lawson said first control of credit in britain rested on interestrates alone due to the freedom of its financial markets he said the second reason was political uncertainty causedby proposed spending plans of the opposition

that baker might turn to george gouldwho holds the number three treasury position ofundersecretary gould another close confidante has known baker for years before joining the treasury in november gould was apartner at the wall steet firm of wertheim and co and formerlyheaded donaldson lufkin and jenrette securities corp the darman announcement came on the eve of the semiannualmeetings of the international monetary fund and the world bankwhere many policies darman helped shape will be debated he helped baker devise the september plaza agreementwhen the united states japan west germany france and britaincurbed the dollars strength the pact was a major turningpoint in us policy ending a period of disdain for economiccooperation and intervention in currency markets darman also worked on some other baker initiatives likethe tokyo summit agreement to intensify coordination ofeconomic policies among the leading industrial countries andthe recent paris agreement to stabilise

totalled half ofof sales to the us against about a third in recent years trade with the us in rose pct for exports and pct for imports in dollar terms but fell pct for exportsand pct for imports in

suddenly instead of the us it is europe that islaying the golden egg said de hora the ec is worried ec business also had a remarkable yearin japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to itsstart from a small base compared with total japanus trade the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive thanus firms a factor which is aggravating the exchange rateimbalance and which will

bundesbank forboosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of aninternational accord to stabilize currency values nigel lawson british chancellor of the exchequer wasamong those who said the treasury secretarys statements helpedspur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investorsthink that a clash between the two major economic powers woulddamage the world economy lawson told a london television interviewer tuesday ithink the scale of the stock fall was very great that ithink was partly due to statements that have been made bysenior figures on the other side of the atlantic

responsible for this but ifyou go back to see what caused it unsettling of financialmarkets it was west german policy said robert brusca ofnikko securities international in new york all mr baker did was to mention the obvious in public somaking him responsible for it was a little like killing themessenger he said after mondays talks the us and west german governmentsmade it clear that the louvre currency accord pieced togetherin paris in february was still in effect wall street feared that collapse of the agreement might bea prelude to hyperinflation and economic malaise similar tothe late s analysts believe mondays wall street crashwiped out about billion dlrs in stock values treasury sources said that baker already unhappy aboutbonns refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep theglobal recovery moving was angered by a bundesbank interestrate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite he felt that the us recovery inching along in its thmonth could no longer be the only engine of global economicexpansion a growing us economy has been serving as a hugemarket for debtor country exports moreover baker the consummate politician was worriedthat the republican party might face next years presidentialelection with its main showpiece a vibrant economy badlytarnished a rise in global interest rates might worsen the debtcrisis and completely choke off us economic

recent problems with loans todeveloping countries large money center banks with heavyexposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate inan effort to get more profitable spreads on other

convinced that afurther cut in interest rates was needed the economy is picking up after contracting by aseasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter fromthe fourth he added we may have an increase in gnp startingin the second quarter he said in an interview concerned by the first quarter downturn the us has beenpressing west germany to pump up its economy and boost itsimports either through fiscal or monetary policy schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter wasmainly due to adverse weather conditions just as occured in yearonyear growth was thus about two pct he estimated that economic growth for the year as a wholewould probably be between one and two pct it is not a question of monetary conditions if domesticdemand does not grow strongly he said noting that interestrates are at historically low levels and funds are ample schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank moneystock growth was slowing down from its recent yearonyear paceof to eight pct well above the bundesbanks three to sixpct target he said the target could still be achieved but much willdepend on the direction of longterm capital flows heavyinflows particularly in january around the time of the emsrevaluation boosted domestic money supply there is still a certain hope that the net inflow offoreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bitreversed schlesinger said a major reason for the inflows was the markets convictionthat the mark was headed higher as we can see from the marketexpectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark havediminished

seesome correction now but it wouldnt be good to have shorttermfluctuations he said let us wait and see it is mainly the strength of the dollar fall in a veryshort period which was a little bit of a shock than the levelof rates as such schlesinger said the sharp rise of the mark coupled with weak prices ofsuch key commodities as oil had a favourable impact on westgerman inflation down year although there have recently been signs of inflationpicking up he said that this was due to changes in keycommodity prices the underlying inflation rate this year wouldbe unchanged at about one to pct he said schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growthwas longer term in that the economy was building up thepotential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation the abovetarget growth

germany now faced a difficult dilemmaover monetary policy the underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not thereported negative inflation rates last year and west germanywas affected more than

sametime let them get richer by building factories and new homes china has to feed one quarter of the worlds populationbut only one seventh of its land is arable sharp increases in farm output since turned china intoa net grain exporter for the first time in and again in but the rapid industrialisation of the countryside whichhas occurred at the same time has gobbled up arable land forfactories and homes for peasants who can now afford them official figures show that china lost just under one pct ofits arable land to other uses in and a slightly smalleramount last year it gained mln new mouths to feed duringthe two years we lost very little land prior to when theindustrialisation began official xu said since then nearlyall the families in the county have built new homes and manyfactories have gone up last year we lost land to a new railway line xu said butland losses in future should fall because nearly all familiesalready have new houses she added the issue of land loss

province of zhejiang said the government listened toomuch to the demands of selfish city people and could raise citygrain prices without any problem but the government has ruled out a price rise raising theprice of grain would directly conflict with the goal of socialstability said a china daily editorial this month the shanghai official said prices must be reformed over thelong term we must be very careful we have a very largepopulation which is used to price stability and will object toprice rises he said the problem is how to do it the shanghai official said a rise in grain prices mightalso affect the prices of hundreds of food products made withgrain and consumed by city residents in addition the state faces the problem of inadequateinvestment by farmers in land and in grain in particular the official press has reported that farmers fear farmpolicy may change and they are putting their new wealth intobuilding graves memorial halls for ancestors and homes under reforms introduced in the late s farmers signcontracts with the state requiring them to grow certain cropsbut they have considerable freedom in how to use their land as the expiration date of the year contract is almost atthe halfway mark farmers are beginning to worry about thefuture the china daily said in an editorial last month their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed touse the

useof the range within which the guilder and the mark canfluctuate against each other in the european monetary systemems roelof nelissen chairman of amsterdamrotterdam bank nvamro said the central

above that level if itsuddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard toobtain amros nelissen said relatively small changes in interestrates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows

forecast last monthgerman gnp is seen rising by two to pct but with inflationbetween zero and pct according to most german forecasts but despite this upward push on real dutch rates moneydealers do not expect the central bank to cut official ratesindependently without prior moves by the bundesbank following the west german interest rate cuts on january the dutch central bank did not lower its rates but set a pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its creditsurcharge most traders were surprised by this move as they hadexpected the bank to follow suit unconditionally they said the bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impacton the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted while not entirely unsympathetic to critics of itspolicies the central bank keeps its

percentage point lower than in each of theprevious two years gatt experts urged washington to resist protectionism andinstead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the currentaccount payments deficit higher private savings lowerinvestment and a smaller federal budget deficit raising us trade barriers would result in little or noreduction in the current account deficit it would howeverincrease inflation and reduce world trade it said the basic cause some combination of insufficientdomestic savings and an excessive budget deficit wouldremain the report said gatt economists said trade

over thirdworld debt management and looming protectionism the report also said imbalances in the current accounts ofjapan west germany and the us had increased in the most likely explanation was that

notborne out last year the report said gatt warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in theus inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidlyexpanding money supply and low dollar such a development could worsen the business climate byincreasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates which inturn would adversely affect world trade but the report noted a surprising rise in imports

exports and pct for imports in dollar terms but fell pct for exportsand pct for imports in yen terms the basic meaning for europe is that japanese firms have atremendous interest in exporting to europe where every unitsold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is importantto them suddenly instead of the us it is europe that islaying the golden egg said de hora the ec is worried ec business also had a remarkable yearin japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to itsstart from a small base compared with total japanus trade the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive thanus firms a factor which is aggravating the exchange rateimbalance and which will cause problems this currency alignment between japan and the ec isreflecting the excellent performance

lower normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcovercombined with cold temperatures this winter howeversnowcover in soviet grain areas has generally been excellentso the bulk of winterkill

damage confidence in the currency while endangering worldeconomic growth a top bundesbank official said board member leonhard gleske also told a forex associationconference current exchange rates of major currencies can beviewed as equilibrium levels in a mediumterm perspective he said the recent paris agreement on currencystabilisation and policy coordination between the group of fiveand canada may herald an era of greater exchange ratestability the paris agreement was not however an attempt to set uppermanent target zones for exchange rates gleske stressedadding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree andenforce on an international level at present levels the dollar can no longer be consideredgrossly overvalued in relation to the european currencies andthe yen gleske said he said the dollar had fallen much less against currenciesof important trading nations such as canada korea taiwan andhong kong and further falls there may still be necessary but a further dollar depreciation against major europeancurrencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore thedollar to a fully competitive position as measured by itsweighted external value he said in fact a further marked decline in the dollar rate wouldhold two major dangers gleske said first in countries with large balance of paymentssurpluses such as japan and west germany it threatened tohamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of realincome and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe outsurpluses second in the united states it could damage investorsconfidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness tofinance huge fiscal and external payments deficits gleskesaid gleske also was strongly sceptical that an internationalsystem of binding target zones for currencies fluctuating innarrow bands against each other can be established suchtargets threatened to cause policy conflicts both withincountries and between them for instance the us reliance on foreign capital to fundits deficits requires interest rates there be set at highlevels but domestic considerations call for low ones if target zones were established this would put pressureon other countries to reduce their interest rates even moreeven though this may be in conflict with their own domesticsituation and priorities he said gleske added targeting the exchange rate even within awide margin will meet with serious objections where there is aclearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic andexternal policy priorities commenting on the paris currency accord gleske said itschances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on currentinterest rate differentials being maintained these chances seem to me to rest critically on theexpectation that the current configuration of interest ratesand the monetary policies behind them will assure smoothfinancing of current account imbalances in the months ahead gleske said past experience of currency adjustments hadlearned that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thustend to overshoot he said this would seem to be unnecessaryand should be avoided if at all possible monetary policies can help achieve this but only ifmarkets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies willlead to balanced international payments he said reutergrain,us senator uncommitted on offering bill,washington march,senator richard
